## What is YOURLS

**YOURLS** stands for **Your Own URL Shortener**. It is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (_a la_ TinyURL or bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your data and don't depend on third party services. It's also a great way to add branding to your short URLs, instead of using the same public URL shortener everyone uses.

## YOURLS Features
